## What is MAXIF?

MAXIF is a simple website for inspecting files and checking the file signature and metadata.

## How did you build MAXIF?

MAXIF is built from Vite, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS.

## How do I run MAXIF?

I use `pnpm` as a package manager so you'll need to use that. It's better than `npm` and `yarn`, trust me.

```bash
pnpm i
pnpm dev
```

You can run `pnpm build` to build the project.

## Can I contribute to MAXIF?

Yes, please do :)
